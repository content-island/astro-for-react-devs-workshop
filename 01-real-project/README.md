# 🚀 Astro for React Developers — React Alicante 2025

_Material for the workshop delivered by the **Content Island** team_

This repository contains the official demos and step-by-step guides for **Astro For React Developers**, presented at **React Alicante 2025**. It’s split into two main parts:

- 📘 **00-astro-101** — fundamentals, each demo with its own README.
- 🛠️ **01-real-project** — a progressive build of a real blog with good design and a headless CMS, solving challenges step by step (from component tweaks to page-level work, content islands, server actions, and a final hands-on lab).

Each subfolder includes a **README** with the precise steps for that demo.
