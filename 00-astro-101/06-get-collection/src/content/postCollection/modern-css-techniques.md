CSS has evolved significantly in recent years, introducing features that simplify development and improve user experience.

## Container Queries

Container queries allow applying styles based on the parent container's size instead of the viewport:

```css
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  }
}
```

## Cascade Layers

Cascade layers offer more granular control over specificity:

```css
@layer reset, base, theme, components, utilities;

@layer base {
  h1 {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
}
```

## Subgrid

Subgrid allows child elements to participate in the parent's grid:

```css
.parent {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}

.child {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
```

These features are changing the way we build modern web interfaces.
